			<h3>Divine Guardians</h3>
				<div class="about-title">

					<p>What is a Divine guardian?</p>

				</div>

				<div class="about-paragraph">

					<p>
						A Divine Guardian is a passionate perceptive protector of faith and truth who embodies the strength and full armour of our creator, God (Grantor of Dominion) and wisdom of a magi, that is naturally compelled to stand up against adversity, irrationality, tyranny and the often misguided frequent judgement of others.
					<br>
					<br>
					Guardians stand up for those who can’t stand for themselves by showing them the realities of success and possibilities they cannot yet see in themselves.  By their very nature, they are durable pupils of life, experiencing what God has gifted them and doing the best they can with it.
					<br>
					<br>
					They give because they want to create something better and genuinely care for others.  The world is better because they’re making it so.  These are also the unsung heroes at home or in school who say no and question narratives or illogical conclusions to stay true to their values without the influence of corruption driven by ego.
					<br>
					<br>
					“I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live by the light that I have. I must stand with anybody that stands right, and stand with him while he is right, and part with him when he goes wrong.” <span>Abraham Lincoln</span>
					</p>

				<div class="about-title">

					<p>What do we expect from a Divine Guardian?</p>

				</div>

				<div class="about-paragraph">

					<p>
						A Divine Guardian demonstrates compassion, respect and genuine concern for those they help.  A DG keeps up to date on current procedures and methods and is in integrity with the material they are sharing here on this site.
					<br>
					<br>
					Our DGs are expected to communicate clearly and truthfully to members about what they can deliver, including expressing their limitations, so that members engaging with them have reasonable expectations of results and where to take their next steps.
					<br>
					<br>
					“The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” <span>Martin Luther King</span>

					</p>

				<div class="about-title">

					<p>Who are Divine Guardians?</p>

				</div>

				<div class="about-paragraph">

					<p>
						Anyone can be a DG.  They show up where we least expect them and in ways sometimes we cannot imagine.  This site has been designed to provide an avenue to build more DG’s, confident in their ability to respond to adversity and challenges.  In order for us to evolve as a planet, old individual unproductive patterns must dissolve and transform those wicked plots against us into a higher frequency, collective benevolent focus.
					<br>
					<br>
					<span>Matthew 25:30</span> – “Throw out the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
					<br>
					<br>
					<span>Psalm 35:16</span> – “Like godless jesters at a feast, They gnashed at me with their teeth.”

					<p>What does private mean to us?</p>

				</div>

				<div class="about-paragraph">

					<p>
						When you join DG, we expect loyalty to our requirements to privacy and respect to the men and women who have prepared the materials for you to use.  Putting the material on this website in the public realm is not permitted.  You may share your experience with others but the content is deemed private and confidential in nature and particular to the DG who developed it.
					<br>
					<br>
					The free material and resources contained herein are already in the public realm or offered for free by its creator or is part of the public domain.
					<br>
					<br>
					We ask that you respect each creators’ content here as many of the DGs have spent countless hours studying, sacrificing, learning, failing, succeeding and remaining persistent in their pursuit of truth.
